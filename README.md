Run the following commands on terminal to execute the c++ files. 1st line runs the OpenCL version, the second line runs the golden standard

	python OCLscript.py -i multiplication
	python script_GoldenStd.py -i multiplicationGoldenStandard

NB: python scripts should be in the same folders as the c++ files you want to execute when running above commands.
The above commands will compile and run their .cpp programs
Both scripts have loops to execute the c++ program 10 times, 1st iteration not measured since its used for cache warming
